This script exports a GitHub user's starred repositories (URL & description) to a CSV file.

Usage: `python3 export_stars.py --user username > stars.csv`

I recommend to use python venv for the operation of this script.

Thanks to the authors of [PyGitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) for the slick client library.
